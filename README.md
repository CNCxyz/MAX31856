### About MAX31856

    The MAX31856 performs cold-junction compensation and digitizes the signal from
    any type of thermocouple. The output data is formatted in degrees Celsius. This
    converter resolves temperatures to 0.0078125°C, allows readings as high as
    +1800°C and as low as -210°C (depending on thermocouple type), and exhibits
    thermocouple voltage measurement accuracy of ±0.15%. The thermocouple inputs
    are protected against overvoltage conditions up to ±45V.
